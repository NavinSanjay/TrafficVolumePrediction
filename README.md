# TrafficVolumePrediction
The problem discussed in this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the traffic volume at a specified location for a specific date and time. Historical traffic data was leveraged along with relevant features such as date, time, day of the week, month, and weather conditions to build a model.

Historical traffic data was leveraged along with relevant features such as date, time, day of the week, month, and weather conditions to build a model. Machine learning techniques were used to capture patterns, trends and seasonality in the traffic data, enabling it to make accurate predictions for future traffic volumes. The predicted traffic volume will aid in optimizing transportation planning, traffic management and resource allocation. The ultimate goal of enhancing efficiency, reducing congestion and improving overall traffic flow in a target area. 

The EDA and feature engineering processes led to the identification of correlated features. Multiple models were evaluated and compared. The random forest regression proved to be the best model, outperforming all other models in each evaluation metric. The models were then tested on unseen 2018 data, and linear regression and random forest performed the best. However, 2018 has a huge limitation as it is irregular data, therefore making the predictions difficult. Further work needs to be done to ensure that the data used is comparable and consistent.
